- Abuse
- Threats or intimidation of any kind
- Stalking and excessive attention (including photography or recording)
- Doxing or disclosure of any private information
- Off-color humor

This may come in the form of language, imagery, or other forms of communication, and may be in person or online.


# Reporting
If you are the subject of any behavior prohibited by this Code of Conduct, or observe someone who is, please contact a Begin team member immediately.

If you know a Begin team member, you may wish to contact them personally (and you should); but if not, please [contact us via email](mailto:conduct@begin.com).

If possible, please attempt to collect any relevant information and evidence, including links, screenshots, or other recordings of any incident.

Reports will be handled with the utmost care, confidence, and sensitivity towards the individuals reporting.
