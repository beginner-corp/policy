## Agreement to the Begin Community Code of Conduct
By participating and contributing to the Small Wins (aka Begin) community -- including, but not limited to its open source projects, any related online venues such as Github, Slack, and in-person events, etc. -- you agree to the [Begin Code of Conduct](https://github.com/smallwins/policy/blob/master/begin-community-code-of-conduct.md), found at the [Begin Policy archive](https://github.com/smallwins/policy). Lack of familiarity with this Code of Conduct is not an excuse for not adhering to it.

### Issues
Please follow the steps below when opening new issues:
- Read the [README](./README.md). It's there for a reason!

- New issues should include:
  - Clear issue title
